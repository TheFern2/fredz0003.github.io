### Utility Tire (Console program in C++)

In my humble beginnings I created what was my first real program in C++. At the time I knew nothing about OOP, or barely even knew much about DS, and the real purpose of encapsulation. I remember the program was just a bunch of IF statements to get the job done. The program source code was lost when I left my old job. I contacted my old colleague and asked if he could retrieve the EXE for me. To my surprise he still used the program until this day. The OEM manuals were really bulky, and sometimes pages were missing or too greasy. Forklift tires were being replaced on a hour by hour basis, so having quick access to part numbers was a nice feature. [Tire Utility Repo](https://github.com/fredz0003/Tire-Utility)

### Airport Baggage (PLC Siemens S7, and Nirtec machine simulation)

The learning path of my programming career took me to the world of PLC's (Programmable Logic Controllers). Over the last 7 years, I've worked with Allen Bradley and Siemens PLC's. In the world of automation I've done installation and commissioning, debugging, and troubleshooting, of PLC projects of heavy machinery in oil rig platforms. The main goal is to get the cases over to the discharge conveyor and sort small and big cases. The project has a wiki page here if you are interested in more information regarding this project.

### Hidden Essays (Console program in Java)

Stanford university has great resources for self learners. I've taken some of the iOS courses, and they are great. Another great resource is [Nifty Assignments](http://nifty.stanford.edu/). There are well thought out assignments for CS students. I've taken a personal challenge with [Catch Plagiarist](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2008/franke-catch-plagiarists/). Unfortunately I had made major progress on this project the last time I worked on it to process single file data sets, and I forgot to push my changes to git. Time is crunched right now and it will have to wait until I can work on it again.

As it stands the project can compare text files for matching sentences for N amount of words. In the assignment the datasets are not optimized for file input. I had written a class to clean the file, save the number of lines, and offset of each text for fast lookup. As you can imagine a brute force comparison is not the best approach. As the number of text files to be compared increases so does comparison times.

With the changes I lost I could easily compare around 100 text files with each other. Comparing 1300 would take ages. One idea of mine was to sort both files the master and the compare file. So for example if the master contains 10 sentences that start with A, and compare file has 20, that would be 200 comparisons. If the compare file has let's say 1000 sentences that would be a huge time saving approach. If we are not using sorting it would be 10000 comparisons.

### Square Patrol (Unity3d in C#)

By far one of my favorite projects. My kids enjoyed playing it from time to time, and I need to polish and create more levels. I've done in the past other small projects like tic tac toe. In this project everything comes together sound, menu GUI, game controller, levels, and much more. It is a game where you need to reach your green goal without dying, and before time ends. I have packaged it for Windows, and Mac if you are interested in playing it.

### Flycraft (Unity3d in C#) NOTE: Development phase

This project came about because my children love minecraft. Moreover they also enjoy [KSP](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/) (Kerbal Space Program). However KSP is a bit difficult for children. They don't care about the average thrust nor the Max-Q of the ship, they just want to see something fly and do something. I've thought about doing this a couple of different ways. I could do some sort of mod for KSP, or forge mod for minecraft, or use unity and create my own adventures.

The idea is to add a new tab to the inventory for ship blocks, and space items. You would have access to rockets, parachutes, etc, the main components of a ship or plane. For the fuel tanks you would have to do some carfting to produce rocket fuel in mission mode, and in creative you would have fuel tanks available.

I am planing to do creative mode first to get a quick demo out for the kids, and anyone else interested in the project. Then I am planning on doing missions to challenge teenagers and adults. A la Martian-esque style.
